# Unofficial Chimera Builds
Releases of (legal/authorized) unofficial/forked builds of the Chimera jailbreak

# Elgible Builds
There are two exceptions that have been granted that allow for modified ipa's to be legally distributed
1. Permission for me (@mastermike88) or @dhinakg to hexedit and redistribute an ipa with an incremented kernel version check, in the event of Apple releasing an iOS 12 update that incremented the kernel version.
    - Granted in April 2023
2. Permission for builds that are clearly labeled as a fork to be patched with @staturnzz's [chimera_patch](https://github.com/staturnzz/chimera_patch)
    - Granted in May 2024
